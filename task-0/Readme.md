**Install Ubuntu 20.04 [Desktop]**

Installing Ubuntu 20.04 was tough for me. Basically I dont know any thing about Ubuntu. I cleared my doubts by seeing Youtube videos. By this task I came to know about the various BIOS system (UEFI). After the installation i had a problem with dualbooting the system and it was cleared by one of the senior in our group and by Youtube videos.
